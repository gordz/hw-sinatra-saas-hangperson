# Assignment 1 - Sinatra
## Thoughts
Lots was covered in this assignment! As a developer of 10 years, a lot of the concepts covered were only starting to
become mainstream when I began my career. The patterns and processes I have picked up throughout the years
(e.g, using Cucumber for BDD, TDD, red -> green -> refactor cycle) have been solidified by this assignment and the
lectures.

Coming from a Java background and with some exposure to Ruby, there is a lot to digest here, however many of the
concepts are the same. Ruby has some nice tooling to support TDD, with ‘auto test’ and ‘rerun’ proving extemely useful,
something that Java has only recently gotten right in some newer frameworks (e.g Play!, Spring Boot).


## Pairing
I have worked in pairing environments; great for sharing knowledge, patterns, idioms and great for team building,
however it does impact dev speed. It takes a cultural shift and full commitment from the dev team in order for pairing
to work properly.
